## ✅ Code Style Guidelines

Please adhere to these conventions:

* **PSR-12:** Follow the PSR-12 coding standard for PHP.
* **Naming:**
    * Use **camelCase** for variables and functions/methods (`$myVariable`, `getUserData()`).
    * Use **PascalCase** for class names (`MyClass`, `PostController`).
* **Readability:** Separate logic into small, focused functions/methods.
* **Comments:** Use PHPDoc blocks (`/** ... */`) for classes and methods. Use inline comments (`// ...`) to explain complex or non-obvious logic sections. Comments should be in **English**.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure Guide

To maintain consistency, please place files according to this structure (based on the project constitution):

* `app/` → Application-specific code:
    * `app/Controllers/` → Request handling logic.
    * `app/Models/` → Database table representations (extend `BaseModel`).
    * `app/ViewComposers/` → Logic for injecting data into specific layouts/views.
* `src/` → Core framework code (Namespaced under `PhpLiteCore`). Subdirectories like `Database`, `Routing`, `Lang`, `View`, etc.
* `routes/` → Route definitions (`web.php`).
* `public/` → Publicly accessible web root **ONLY** for built assets.
    * `public/assets/` → Compiled CSS and JS files from Webpack.
* `resources/` → Source files before compilation:
    * `resources/js/` → Source JavaScript.
    * `resources/scss/` → Source SCSS.
    * `resources/lang/` → Language translation files.
* `views/` → Template files:
    * `views/layouts/` → Main layout files (e.g., `app.php`).
    * `views/partials/` → Reusable template snippets (e.g., `header.php`).
    * `views/themes/default/` → Application-specific view files.
    * `views/system/` → Default framework error pages.
* `storage/` → Writable directories for logs, cache (if implemented), etc.
* `tests/` → Automated tests (PHPUnit/Pest).

## 🛡 Security Guidelines

Security is paramount:

* **Sanitize & Validate:** Always validate incoming data (`src/Validation/Validator.php`) and sanitize output (e.g., use `htmlspecialchars()` in views).
* **Database:** The Active Record / Query Builder uses PDO prepared statements internally, protecting against basic SQL injection when used correctly. Be cautious with raw queries (`$app->db->raw()`).
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Always escape output in views using `htmlspecialchars()`.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** *(Note: CSRF protection is not yet implemented in the core - consider adding it)*.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

* If your change affects core functionality, consider adding a unit or feature test in the `tests/` directory.
* Run existing tests if applicable.
* Manually test your changes thoroughly in a development environment.
* When fixing a bug, explain the original issue and how your fix resolves it in the PR description.

You can run basic PHP syntax checks locally:
```bash
# Find all PHP files and check syntax
find . -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \; | grep "Errors parsing"
```

## 🌐 Network Configuration

If you're working in an environment with firewall restrictions or need to configure GitHub Actions/Copilot coding agents for external resource access, see the **[Network Configuration Guide](NETWORK_CONFIGURATION.md)** for detailed instructions on:
- Configuring Actions setup steps
- Adding URLs to custom allowlists
- Proxy configuration
- Troubleshooting network issues

## 📄 composer.lock reminder
When you modify composer.json (add/update/remove dependencies), run:
composer update
Commit the resulting composer.lock file together with composer.json.
CI enforces that composer.lock matches composer.json and will fail otherwise.
